This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project, initially bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

Prior to running this locally, you'll need [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download) installed on your system.

## Getting Started

2. Configure the `/config/config.json` file with your account names for various platforms.

3. Install the required packages: `npm install` or `yarn install`.

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
